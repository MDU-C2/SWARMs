the libjpeg library is added as source code to the tmp project in xilinx sdk.

downloaded the library from: http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsrc.v9.tar.gz
, extracted and put the files in 2014.2/src (in the search path i xilinx sdk). 

i think we ran the :/configure command from: 
http://www.ridgesolutions.ie/index.php/2013/05/15/cross-compiling-libjpeg-for-linux-on-arm/
but not sure if that helped us.

followed the code here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13384104/jpeg-encoding-bitmap-bmp-image-from-file-using-libjpeg-c
but had to tweak it a bit. the structs contained WORD, DWORD and other windows variables so they
had to be changed. we declared them like this:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14279242/read-bitmap-file-into-structure
but with corresponding int, ex: uint16_t WORD

we checked the arguments and changed from fread_s() to fread().

the function write_JPEG_file was not the one we wanted so we used write_jpeg_file from:
http://www.aaronmr.com/en/2010/03/test/

the last part was that the number of bytes in the fileheader and infoheader that are used to save bmp
in the sdk was not the same as the number of bytes that was read for the input file in the code.
